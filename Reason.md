## When you write the line: `res.send("Post added successfully!");`

### `res.send` Terminates the Response:

## When you call `res.send("Post added successfully!")`, it immediately sends a response back to the client, ending the request-response cycle.

## After calling res.send, the subsequent `res.redirect("/posts")` will not execute because the response has already been sent.

## `res.redirect` Depends on a Single Response:

### A route can send only one response per request. You must choose whether to use res.send or res.redirect. Using both in the same route handler will not work correctly.
